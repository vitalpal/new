  quote: "<p>Hey! I’m Norman, the founder of VitalPal. I am very passionate about health, but as I know all too well it is not easy to maintain a healthy lifestyle while keeping up with a busy schedule.</p><p>Over the last few years I consulted many specialists, changed my diet, worked-out, did 10 days of silent meditation, practiced Yoga and spent hundreds of hours on educating myself while studying full time and working two jobs.</p><p>The number one issue that keeps coming up is changing deeply ingrained habits. This is no simple matter and this is the challenge we face in making healthy habits part of our daily lives. The reason I founded VitalPal is because I want to pass on what I learned and help you supercharge your brain and body.</p><p>See you soon!</p>"
